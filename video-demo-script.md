## 📝 Script

### Opening (0:00 - 0:20) - 20 seconds

**[Visual: Project logo/title slide]**

> "Hi! I'm [Your Name], and I'm excited to present **EduAssist AI** - a multi-agent educational support system built with Google's Agent Development Kit for the AI Agents Intensive Capstone Project.
>
> This project tackles a critical problem in education: students need comprehensive, personalized support that goes beyond just answering questions."

---

### Problem Statement (0:20 - 0:45) - 25 seconds

**[Visual: Statistics slide showing education challenges]**

> "Students today face overwhelming challenges:
> - **Fragmented learning tools** that don't talk to each other
> - **Generic guidance** that doesn't fit individual needs  
> - **Limited mental health support** during stressful academic periods
> - **Information overload** when searching for quality resources
>
> Traditional educational tools operate in silos, failing to provide the holistic support students truly need."

---

### Why Agents? (0:45 - 1:05) - 20 seconds

**[Visual: Agent architecture diagram]**

> "So why use AI agents to solve this?
>
> **Agents are perfect for education** because:
> 1. Each agent can **specialize** in one domain - becoming a true expert
> 2. Agents work **autonomously** but collaborate seamlessly
> 3. They **learn and adapt** to individual student needs
> 4. The system is **scalable** - we can add new capabilities without redesigning everything
>
> This multi-agent approach provides comprehensive support that single-model systems simply can't match."

---

### Architecture Overview (1:05 - 1:35) - 30 seconds

**[Visual: System architecture diagram with animation]**

> "EduAssist AI uses a hierarchical multi-agent architecture powered by Google's Agent Development Kit.
>
> At the top, we have a **Coordinator Agent** that intelligently routes student requests to four specialized agents:
>
> 1. **Learning Assistant** - explains concepts and generates practice problems
> 2. **Study Planner** - creates personalized schedules and tracks progress  
> 3. **Wellness Coach** - provides mental health support and stress management
> 4. **Resource Finder** - discovers quality educational materials
>
> These agents use **sequential and parallel workflows** to handle complex requests efficiently.
>
> The system leverages:
> - **Gemini 2.0 Flash** for fast, intelligent responses
> - **Built-in tools** like Google Search and Code Execution
> - **4 custom tools** for schedules, progress tracking, wellness, and resource curation
> - **Session management** to maintain context across conversations
> - **State persistence** to remember student preferences and progress"

---

### Live Demo (1:35 - 2:25) - 50 seconds

**[Visual: Terminal/CLI showing live interaction]**

> "Let me show you EduAssist AI in action. Watch as I interact with the system:
>
> **[Type]** "Explain binary search trees in simple terms"
>
> **[Show response]** Notice how the Learning Assistant provides a clear, beginner-friendly explanation with examples.
>
> **[Type]** "Create a 2-week study plan for data structures, 3 hours daily"
>
> **[Show response]** The Study Planner generates a detailed, realistic schedule using our custom schedule_creator tool.
>
> **[Type]** "I'm feeling stressed about upcoming exams"
>
> **[Show response]** The Wellness Coach immediately assesses the situation and provides stress management techniques - showing the system's holistic approach.
>
> **[Type]** "Find good resources for learning Python"
>
> **[Show response]** The Resource Finder searches and curates quality materials from trusted sources.
>
> What's powerful is when requests need multiple agents - the coordinator seamlessly orchestrates them to provide comprehensive support."
